author_bio: As a Software Engineer in an agile team, I work towards transforming the software development
            and validation of highly automated driving functions from the real vehicle into the virtual world. While 
            continuously improving my programming skills in C++ and Python on the job, I fulfil my passion for 
            Artificial Intelligence by taking up online courses and reading articles in my personal time.
